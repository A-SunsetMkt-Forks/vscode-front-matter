## ‚ùì What is Front Matter?

Front Matter is a CMS that runs within Visual Studio Code. It gives you the power and control of a full-blown CMS while also providing you the flexibility and speed of the static site generator of your choice. Jump right into editing and creating content with Front Matter and be able to preview it straight in VS Code.

The extension supports various static-site generators and frameworks like Hugo, Jekyll, Hexo, NextJs, Gatsby, and more.

A couple of our extension highlights that hopefully get you interested in giving Front Matter a try:

- Content, data, and media management
  - Search, filter, sort, etc. all your content
  - Create new content
  - Supporting tools to edit content and media
- Preview your site/content straight in Visual Studio Code
- SEO checks for title, description, and keywords
- Extensibility
  - As we know, we cannot support all use cases. We provide a way to extend the functionality of the extension to your needs
- and many more features ...
